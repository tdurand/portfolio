intro: |
    I'm a French Front-end engineer with 5 years of profesionnal experience working with web technologies _(and more than 10 years of passion for the web)_. I'm visually oriented and practical, and i love to create simple, intuitive, and effective interfaces that make our complex world a little simpler.

    My mission is to make your business more efficient by creating or improving your interfaces, but also increase their lifespan and maintenance cost.

    I can work with you on the most suitable solution to your needs, i have gained experience in mobile apps (Phonegap), business interfaces (dashboards, stock management, e-learning platform ..), responsive websites, UX thinking, and done some crazy innovative interfaces. I've worked with solo team up to tens of engineers, on 2 weeks projects up to 6+ months.

    I'm working remotely since 5 years, communication won't be an issue, i will fit in your workflow and suggest improvements if needed. I can work in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese.
