    I have been working on contract work on the [toptal platform](https://www.toptal.com/resume/thibault-durand), on React.js & Flux architectures for almost 1 year now.

    I believe React.js and Redux are a big step forward to build performant, maintainable, modular and testable interfaces, I have been working on internal dashboards,
    an eventbrite like app, and I'm currently working on building a complete online learning platform for [Techchange](techchange.org).

    Previous to that I have also been working for 3 years on a PhoneGap App for [Mosalingua](http://www.mosalingua.com), where I built a complete mobile app with Backbone.js and a custom UI, shipping to
    hundred of thousands customers on both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/anglais-apprendre-avec-mosalingua/id399804936?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mosalingua.en).

    Having been living in South America for 4 years, I always been amazed by their street vendors,
     and I recently had the opportunity to partner up with a Colombian film maker to build this [interactive
    documentary](https://pregonerosdemedellin.com).

    It features the day to day life of the street vendors of Medell√≠n in a Street View like experience, you can 
    stroll through the streets and see short documentaries about their life.

    You can read a [detailed blog post](https://medium.com/@tibbb/how-we-created-an-immersive-street-walk-experience-with-a-gopro-and-javascript-f442cf8aa2dd)
     about it, it was a big technical challenge to figure
    out how to build a custom google street view: from filming it to building the interface.

    We have been selected in film festivals: FIPA (France), FilmGate Miami (U.S), DOK Leipzik (Germany)...

- name: Responsive Websites
  date: Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, SVG, Javascript

    The past year I have been building more traditional responsive websites, mainly for small business.

    Most of the time just do the integration from Sketch, Illustrator, Photoshop files in a full responsive, pixel perfect and performant HTML, CSS, Javascript website.

    But I can also build the fullstack and use a [Content as Service](http://ecmarchitect.com/archives/2014/10/27/3944) provider like [prismic.io](https://prismic.io/) 
    to provide a flexible and powerful way to manage, versioned content with a user friendly interface and no code.

    The websites I build are [fully optimized](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/technical-seo-2015-wiring-websites-organic-search/) for SEO.

    I led the technical development of the [MosaLingua apps](mosalingua.com) for 3 years where I oversaw a complete rewrite with PhoneGap/Backbone.js/SASS for both Android and iOS (one codebase) and rethought of UX design of several features.
    
    Deployed each 2 months for hundred of thousands users and worked remotely with a team of 10 across 3 continents, and managed feedback from users in 4 languages.

    I've been learning a lot on specifics challenges of both iOS and Android devices (and webviews) and surfed at the edge of PhoneGap and hybrid apps possibilities.

    I'm currently really enthusiast of seeing React Native coming to the light, I didn't have the chance to work with it yet, but my hope is that it can solve some issues of multiplatform mobile app development that PhoneGap can't.

    On every project I work on, I use a critical UX eye, trying to make the user experience the simpler I can.

    One of the best presentation I've seen on UX design [was given by @mrjoe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-0NQ_bb4C8), in one sentence: [design for emotion](http://www.amazon.com/Seductive-Interaction-Design-Effective-Experiences/dp/0321725522) and [match human mental models](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/).

    I usually sketch on pencil and paper, but can do mockups of UX ideas on Omigraffle or Invision. I did a bit of user testing 
    on the webdocumentary I worked on, but usually projects don't have such budget.

    My Open Source work is a bit limited, but if you head to my GitHub profile, you will see that:

    - I've built a [simple Bus transit visualization](http://tdurand.github.io/mapafortaleza/) for South American chaotic bus networks and inexistent maps.
     I blogged [about it](http://tdurand.tumblr.com/post/31393552608/how-i-created-a-bus-map-of-fortaleza-brazil) few years ago, it is now used 1000 times a day in Fortaleza (Brazil).

    - The work on [the webdocumentary](https://github.com/tdurand/pregoneros-de-medellin) I built is open source, I blogged [about it](https://medium.com/@tibbb/how-we-created-an-immersive-street-walk-experience-with-a-gopro-and-javascript-f442cf8aa2dd) too.

    - I've been submitting few PRs on PhoneGap plugins and javascript libraries / tools.
